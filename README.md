# StackOverflow-semantic-search
## A semantic search engine for StackOverflow questions
Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/stacksample
        size: 3gb (zipped)
        loading : loading the dataset using Pandas would be a big mistake if you don't have about 5+ Gb of free ram as only the Questions.csv and Answers.csv takes about 5 Gb
                  to load the data use import csv and the encoding is latin1. A basic Data Loading exercise is presented in 'readData.py' just for reference.
